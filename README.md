Our aim is to estimate those average annual health insurance costs (excess charges) of a beneficiary residing in the US, as well as to estimate the proportion of beneficiaries whose health insurance costs amount to more than $10,000 in a particular year, using four different sampling techniques to determine which sampling method gives us the most accurate results.
